My name is Parker Donahue.

As a Computer Science student at URI pursuing a Bachelor of Science, I bring a solid foundation in programming and web development to the table. With experience in languages such as C++, JavaScript, CSS, and Python, I have an understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies.

Through coursework and personal projects, I've honed my skills in designing user interfaces, implementing efficient algorithms, and leveraging various frameworks. I plan to continue expanding my knowledge and applying it to real-world challenges.
